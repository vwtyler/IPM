## Social Network Analysis Tool

This tool is in progress. Current data includes nodes from the Western IPM Center office. Coding is done with R Studio.

## How to use

This tool has a few important files to consider. IPM.Rproj is the project file and will put you in the correct working directory for the R markdown code. The sna.Rmd file contains the code for using nodes and edges to make a social network graph along with various numerical measures of the data contained within the graph.

The data_cleaning.Rmd contains sample code for cleaning up database data and converting it to nodes and edges. This particular file should only be referenced as an example, while your data may not fit into this method exactly.
